# Password-Generator
Homework for Week 3 - Javascript

Within this password generator is a Javascript file that includes the code needed to:
* activate the sequence with an Event Listener
* prompt the user to enter parameters such as length and type of characters included
* enter or exclude Uppercase letters, Lowercase letters, Numbers, and Special Characters (!@#$%^&*())
* great an ongoing loop that will generate new characters until the desired length is reached
* generate random characters rather than cycling through conventional organization methods
* stop the loop from continuing past the length needed
* disassemble, scramble, and reassemble the characters to create a unique password
